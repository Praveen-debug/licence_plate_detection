# License Plate Detection

This project detects vehicles and their license plates using computer vision. It utilizes a custom-trained YOLO model for license plate detection and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. OpenCV (`cv2`) is used for image processing tasks.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Running the program**

To start the program, use:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This project can run in real-time with a good GPU, but it also supports saving detections for later analysis.
